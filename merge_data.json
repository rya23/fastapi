                "description": "The first meeting of the Council of Ministers during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third term was held on Wednesday (August 28) at Sushma Swaraj Bhavan in Delhi. The meeting, chaired by PM Modi, lasted around five hours and fifty minutes. During the session, the Central Cabinet for Economic Affairs approved the establishment of 12 new industrial smart cities in 9 states. Spread across 10 states and aligned with six major corridors, these 12 industrial smart cities are expected to significantly boost manufacturing. Under the National Industrial Corridor Development Program, the government will invest \u20b928,602 crore in these projects. According to Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, these industrial smart cities will form a grand network along the Golden Quadrilateral, creating 1 million direct and 3 million indirect jobs. These projects are expected to generate an investment potential of \u20b91.52 lakh crore, with a target of achieving \u20b92 lakh crore in exports by 2030. The projects are anticipated to be completed by 2027, with five located near the Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor and two near the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. One project each will be near the Visakhapatnam-Chennai, Hyderabad-Bengaluru, Hyderabad-Nagpur, and Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridors. The 12th smart city will be in Haryana, though its exact location has not been disclosed. Notably, the Central Cabinet has approved eight infrastructure projects worth \u20b92 lakh crore in the past three months. During the meeting, PM Modi reviewed the progress of the government's first 100-day agenda, with officials presenting reports on the work done. The focus was on schemes related to women, the poor, youth, and farmers. PM Modi emphasized the need for ministers and bureaucrats to focus on addressing the challenges faced by women and the underprivileged. Secretaries from various government departments attended the meeting. PM Modi urged quick responses on social media and emphasized maintaining the same pace of work seen over the last decade for the next five years. He promoted the slogan \"Perform, Reform, Transform, and Inform.\" The NDA government has set the goal of making India a developed nation by 2047 by addressing basic needs.",

On August 28, Pai shared a chart on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighting discrepancies between individual incomes and corporate net incomes.\"Individual's income is more than corporate net income, corporates pay higher average rate. Income tax data for AY 23-24 gives full data,\" Pai commented in his post.Individuals income is more than corporate net income, corporates pay higher average rate. \u2066\u2066@IncomeTaxIndia\u2069 data for AY 23-24 gives full data \u2066@FinMinIndia\u2069 \u2066@nsitharaman\u2069 pic.twitter.com/NTjRKjNJqA\u2014 Mohandas Pai (@TVMohandasPai) August 28, 2024Pai has consistently criticised the government's tax policies over the past few months, raising issues related to the burden on the middle and salaried classes. He has frequently expressed his concerns on social media and in various media interviews.Earlier, Pai vehemently criticised the Rs 32,000 crore Goods and Services Tax (GST) demand issued to Infosys, calling it a prime example of 'tax terrorism.' He noted that Indian software service companies have been exporting for over 30 years, contributing to nearly 95 percent of export revenues. He emphasized that exports are exempt from GST. \"If this notice is accurate, it represents a blatant case of tax terrorism. It's outrageous,\" said Pai, who is also the Chairman of Aarin Capital, in an interview with Moneycontrol.\"The Finance Ministry should intervene immediately. Such tax terrorism severely affects investment into India,\" he added.On the other hand, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has intensified his criticism of the government's tax policies, accusing the Centre of engaging in \"tax terrorism.\" Gandhi alleged that the government is placing an undue tax burden on the middle class to benefit corporate \"friends,\" according to a report by PTI.Gandhi questioned why the middle class, which already bears the brunt of high GST on goods, is subjected to increasing tax rates. He argued that this taxation strategy serves the interests of the wealthy while further burdening ordinary citizens.In response to the growing discourse, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra provided updates on the income tax department's recent activities. On August 21, Malhotra announced that nearly 4.98 crore income tax returns (ITRs) for AY 2024-25 had been processed within 15 days. He also noted that over 7.28 crore ITRs were filed by the July 31, 2024 deadline.Malhotra highlighted the significant growth in direct tax revenues over the last decade, which have risen from Rs 5.59 lakh crore to Rs 20 lakh crore. The tax-to-GDP ratio has also seen an increase from 5.6 per cent to 6 per cent during this period.As the debate over tax policies intensifies, the middle class remains at the forefront of this ongoing discourse.",

He further has cited that there is no appropriate forum in the party to express his grief hence he is tendering his resignation from prime membership and other positions. \u0906\u091c \u091d\u093e\u0930\u0916\u0902\u0921 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092e\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0925\u092e\u093f\u0915 \u0938\u0926\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093e \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092a\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917-\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0964 \u091d\u093e\u0930\u0916\u0902\u0921 \u0915\u0947 \u0906\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902, \u092e\u0942\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902, \u0926\u0932\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0902, \u092a\u093f\u091b\u0921\u093c\u094b\u0902 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0906\u092e \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0918\u0930\u094d\u0937 \u091c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0947\u0917\u093e\u0964 pic.twitter.com/ZpAmm2dopr \u2014 Champai Soren (@ChampaiSoren) August 28, 2024 Soren in the letter further has underscored that JMM has deviated from its path and the current working style and policies of the party has forced him to bid a goodbye. The former Chief Minister however asserted that he will continue his struggle on the issues of tribals, natives, Dalits, backward people and common masses. Soren resignation has arrived hours after the Chief Minister of Assam, Himata Biswa Sharma made startling claims that the former Chief Minister was being observed by the officials of the special branch of Jharkhand police. Read more at: Congress-JMM government of Jharkhand engaged spy behind Champai Soren; 2 detained in Delhi: Himanta Biswa Sarma...... The development attracted sharp reactions from another senior leader of the BJP, Babu Lal Marandi who claimed that there is information of state government misusing the police machinery to spy not only on opposition leaders and cabinet ministers but judges also. Marandi further demanded that the matter should be investigated by a committee headed by a sitting judge of High Court. \u0939\u0947\u092e\u0902\u0924 \u0938\u094b\u0930\u0947\u0928, \u0914\u0930\u0902\u0917\u091c\u0947\u092c \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u0915\u094d\u0936\u0947\u0915\u0926\u092e \u092a\u0930 \u091a\u0932\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0928\u0940\u091a\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e \u092a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 \u0914\u0930\u0902\u0917\u091c\u0947\u092c \u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0936\u093e\u0939\u091c\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0948\u0926 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0916\u093e \u0925\u093e\u0964 \u0920\u0940\u0915 \u0909\u0938\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0947\u092e\u0902\u0924 \u0938\u094b\u0930\u0947\u0928 \u092d\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0924\u0941\u0932\u094d\u092f \u091a\u0902\u092a\u0908 \u0938\u094b\u0930\u0947\u0928 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0938\u0942\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e \u092c\u091a\u093e\u090f \u0930\u0916\u0928\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0924\u094b... pic.twitter.com/HpXedNXrVt \u2014 Office of Babulal Marandi (@babulalmarandi) August 28, 2024 Notably, Himanta Biswa Sarma in a social media post on Monday announced Soren\u2019s decision to join the BJP. \u201cFormer Chief Minister of Jharkhand and a distinguished Adivasi (Janjati) leader of our country, Champai Soren, met Union Home Minister Amit Shah a short while ago, He will officially join the BJP on August 30 in Ranchi, said the Assam CM on X.

                "description": "New Delhi: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday that a satellite-based toll system would be introduced on the Indian highways which would ensure a seamless movement of traffic and reduce congestion. Speaking at a media event here, the Union Minister said that the satellite-based system would deduct tolls from vehicles based on the kilometres travelled and help root out instances of higher fees that result from multiple toll booths over short distances. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology represents a major upgrade from the existing FASTag system. GNSS automatically calculates the distance travelled and deducts the appropriate toll fee. This ensures motorists pay only for the distance they have covered, leading to potential savings on every trip. The system will eliminate the need for traditional toll booths, easing traffic congestion and reducing travel time by eliminating long queues. The satellite-based system is being tested on the Bengaluru-Mysuru National Highway (NH-275) in Karnataka and the Panipat-Hisar National Highway (NH-709) in Haryana. Once approved, the GNSS toll collection system will be rolled out in phases, initially covering major highways that connect key cities. NHAI's subsidiary Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL) recently organised an international workshop to discuss the rolling out the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based Electronic Toll Collection in India. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari was the chief guest at the event attended by senior officials. Industry experts from the US and Europe attended the workshop and deliberated on various aspects related to the smooth implementation of the free-flow toll system based on GNSS technology in India. The current FASTag system in India is an electronic toll collection method that utilises Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to streamline toll payments on highways. Introduced to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance efficiency, FASTag enables vehicles to pass through toll plazas without stopping for cash transactions. However, the GNSS technology is superior and would streamline the system further. (IANS)",

The meeting, chaired by PM Modi, lasted around five hours and fifty minutes. During the session, the Central Cabinet for Economic Affairs approved the establishment of 12 new industrial smart cities in 9 states. Spread across 10 states and aligned with six major corridors, these 12 industrial smart cities are expected to significantly boost manufacturing. Under the National Industrial Corridor Development Program, the government will invest \u20b928,602 crore in these projects. According to Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, these industrial smart cities will form a grand network along the Golden Quadrilateral, creating 1 million direct and 3 million indirect jobs. These projects are expected to generate an investment potential of \u20b91.52 lakh crore, with a target of achieving \u20b92 lakh crore in exports by 2030. The projects are anticipated to be completed by 2027, with five located near the Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor and two near the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. One project each will be near the Visakhapatnam-Chennai, Hyderabad-Bengaluru, Hyderabad-Nagpur, and Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridors. The 12th smart city will be in Haryana, though its exact location has not been disclosed. Notably, the Central Cabinet has approved eight infrastructure projects worth \u20b92 lakh crore in the past three months. During the meeting, PM Modi reviewed the progress of the government's first 100-day agenda, with officials presenting reports on the work done. The focus was on schemes related to women, the poor, youth, and farmers. PM Modi emphasized the need for ministers and bureaucrats to focus on addressing the challenges faced by women and the underprivileged.
