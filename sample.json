                "description": "The first meeting of the Council of Ministers during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third term was held on Wednesday (August 28) at Sushma Swaraj Bhavan in Delhi. The meeting, chaired by PM Modi, lasted around five hours and fifty minutes. During the session, the Central Cabinet for Economic Affairs approved the establishment of 12 new industrial smart cities in 9 states. Spread across 10 states and aligned with six major corridors, these 12 industrial smart cities are expected to significantly boost manufacturing. Under the National Industrial Corridor Development Program, the government will invest \u20b928,602 crore in these projects. According to Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, these industrial smart cities will form a grand network along the Golden Quadrilateral, creating 1 million direct and 3 million indirect jobs. These projects are expected to generate an investment potential of \u20b91.52 lakh crore, with a target of achieving \u20b92 lakh crore in exports by 2030. The projects are anticipated to be completed by 2027, with five located near the Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor and two near the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. One project each will be near the Visakhapatnam-Chennai, Hyderabad-Bengaluru, Hyderabad-Nagpur, and Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridors. The 12th smart city will be in Haryana, though its exact location has not been disclosed. Notably, the Central Cabinet has approved eight infrastructure projects worth \u20b92 lakh crore in the past three months. During the meeting, PM Modi reviewed the progress of the government's first 100-day agenda, with officials presenting reports on the work done. The focus was on schemes related to women, the poor, youth, and farmers. PM Modi emphasized the need for ministers and bureaucrats to focus on addressing the challenges faced by women and the underprivileged. Secretaries from various government departments attended the meeting. PM Modi urged quick responses on social media and emphasized maintaining the same pace of work seen over the last decade for the next five years. He promoted the slogan \"Perform, Reform, Transform, and Inform.\" The NDA government has set the goal of making India a developed nation by 2047 by addressing basic needs.",

                "description": "New Delhi: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday that a satellite-based toll system would be introduced on the Indian highways which would ensure a seamless movement of traffic and reduce congestion. Speaking at a media event here, the Union Minister said that the satellite-based system would deduct tolls from vehicles based on the kilometres travelled and help root out instances of higher fees that result from multiple toll booths over short distances. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology represents a major upgrade from the existing FASTag system. GNSS automatically calculates the distance travelled and deducts the appropriate toll fee. This ensures motorists pay only for the distance they have covered, leading to potential savings on every trip. The system will eliminate the need for traditional toll booths, easing traffic congestion and reducing travel time by eliminating long queues. The satellite-based system is being tested on the Bengaluru-Mysuru National Highway (NH-275) in Karnataka and the Panipat-Hisar National Highway (NH-709) in Haryana. Once approved, the GNSS toll collection system will be rolled out in phases, initially covering major highways that connect key cities. NHAI's subsidiary Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL) recently organised an international workshop to discuss the rolling out the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based Electronic Toll Collection in India. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari was the chief guest at the event attended by senior officials. Industry experts from the US and Europe attended the workshop and deliberated on various aspects related to the smooth implementation of the free-flow toll system based on GNSS technology in India. The current FASTag system in India is an electronic toll collection method that utilises Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to streamline toll payments on highways. Introduced to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance efficiency, FASTag enables vehicles to pass through toll plazas without stopping for cash transactions. However, the GNSS technology is superior and would streamline the system further. (IANS)",

                "description": "Washington, Aug 29 (PTI): The Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is willing to engage in \"unprecedented\" levels of cooperation with the United States, mainly due to Chinese aggression, but at the same time is \"fearful\" both of \"entrapment and abandonment\", former US National Security Adviser Lt Gen (retd) H R McMaster has stated in his latest book. Giving the firsthand account of his tenure during the Donald Trump administration as the National Security Advisor, McMaster in his book \"At War With Ourselves\u201d, that hit the bookstores this Tuesday, says he met his Indian counterpart Ajit K Doval a day before he was fired by Trump. \u201cThe day before I was fired, I met for dinner with my Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, at Quarters 13, Fort McNair, a quiet place at the intersection of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers, just south of the US Capitol. Doval is a character straight out of central casting. Betraying his background as the former director of his country\u2019s Intelligence Bureau, he would lean into conversations, cock his head to the side as he spoke, and use hushed tones, even when discussing the most routine subjects,\u201d McMaster writes. \u201cDuring our walk after dinner, he whispered, 'How much longer will we work together?' It did not take someone with Doval\u2019s intelligence background to figure out I was departing the Trump administration. Without answering directly, I told him it had been a privilege and expressed confidence that there would be continuity,\u201d he says. McMaster writes they knew each other well enough for Doval to be direct. \u201cWhat happens in Afghanistan after you leave?\u201d Doval asked him, to which McMaster reminded the Indian NSA that Trump had approved the South Asia strategy last August and that it was the first reasoned and sustainable strategy in 17 years of war. \"Doval knew this, but sometimes you cannot be fully candid with even your closest foreign counterparts. In fact, I shared Doval\u2019s concern, and I knew that my response was less than convincing. Trump was unconventional and impulsive. Sometimes his impulses were good. Other times, to use one of his turns of phrase, 'not so much',\u201d the American general writes. McMaster in his book gives a detailed account of his trip to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India from April 14\u201317, 2017, during which he met then Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar, Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. The conversation was easy, as Doval, Jaishankar, \"and I believed we had a tremendous opportunity to work together in pursuit of our mutual objectives\u201d, McMaster writes about his meeting at the Janpath residence of Doval. Jaishankar then was the Foreign Secretary and late Sushma Swaraj was the External Affairs Minister. \u201cWe spoke about the war in Afghanistan and the threat to India from nuclear-armed Pakistan, but Jaishankar and Doval spoke mainly about an increasingly aggressive China. The two men were open to unprecedented cooperation thanks to Xi Jinping\u2019s aggression. The deepening partnership between the world\u2019s largest and the world\u2019s oldest democracies seemed logical, but India is fearful both of entrapment into competitions from which it would prefer to abstain and abandonment based on the short American attention span and ambivalence over South Asia,\u201d McMaster writes. \u201cThose 'schizophrenic' anxieties and the legacy of India\u2019s leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War had led to hedging behaviour, especially with Russia, an important source of arms and oil for India,\u201d he states. On the final day of his trip, he met Modi at his residence. \u201cModi gave us a warm welcome. It was clear that deepening and expanding our relationship was a top priority for him. He expressed concern over China\u2019s increasingly aggressive efforts to extend its influence at India\u2019s expense and over its growing military presence in the region,\u201d the former NSA writes. Modi, McMaster says, suggested that the US, India, Japan, and like-minded partners emphasise the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific as an inclusive effort to benefit all, in contrast to China\u2019s 'One Belt One Road' initiative. At the end of the meeting, he says, the prime minister gave him a hug, put his hands on his shoulders, and blessed him. \u201cYou have an aura around you, and you will do good for humanity,\u201d Modi told him. A few months later Trump hosted Modi for a meeting at the White House on June 25-26, 2017. \u201cWe huddled in the Oval Office for a few moments between the meeting with Modi\u2019s delegation in the Cabinet Room and the statements and question-and-answer session in the Rose Garden. I warned Trump that the prime minister was a hugger and, based on how well the visit was going, would probably hug Trump after their statements,\u201d McMaster writes. \u201cAlthough Trump was known to hug the occasional American flag onstage, he was not a big hugger of people. The hug was delivered and reciprocated in a way that was not too awkward. Success. Modi departed on June 27, just two days before Moon\u2019s arrival,\u201d he says. Modi was the first head of state the president and First Lady hosted for dinner in the Blue Room, he noted. PTI LKJ SCY SCY(This story is published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed.

The meeting, chaired by PM Modi, lasted around five hours and fifty minutes. During the session, the Central Cabinet for Economic Affairs approved the establishment of 12 new industrial smart cities in 9 states. Spread across 10 states and aligned with six major corridors, these 12 industrial smart cities are expected to significantly boost manufacturing.

These projects are expected to generate an investment potential of \u20b91.52 lakh crore, with a target of achieving \u20b92 lakh crore in exports by 2030. The projects are anticipated to be completed by 2027, with five located near the Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor and two near the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. One project each will be near the Visakhapatnam-Chennai, Hyderabad-Bengaluru, Hyderabad-Nagpur, and Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridors. The 12th smart city will be in Haryana, though its exact location has not been disclosed. Notably, the Central Cabinet has approved eight infrastructure projects worth \u20b92 lakh crore in the past three months. During the meeting, PM Modi reviewed the progress of the government's first 100-day agenda, with officials presenting reports on the work done.
